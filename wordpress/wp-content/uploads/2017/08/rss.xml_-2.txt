      <description>wolfSSL supports use with &lt;a href=&quot;https://software.intel.com/en-us/sgx&quot;&gt;Intel® SGX&lt;/a&gt; on both Windows and Linux. In addition to being available on both operating systems the Linux example includes running a full TLS connection in a secure Enclave. Examples can be found on GitHub under wolfssl/wolfssl-examples located here (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl-examples&quot;&gt;https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl-examples&lt;/a&gt;). One of the exciting upcoming features this year, is that wolfSSL is planning to be FIPS certified while running inside a secure Enclave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there are questions about current support or the future roadmap feel free to let us know at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@wolfssl.com/&quot;&gt;info@wolfssl.com&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

      <description>Do you need a FIPS 140-2 validated cryptography library for your ARM-based platform?  &lt;a href=&quot;../Products-wolfcrypt.html&quot;&gt;wolfCrypt&lt;/a&gt; has been &lt;a href=&quot;../fips.html&quot;&gt;FIPS 140-2 validated&lt;/a&gt; on several different operating environments to date, some of which have been on resource-constrained ARM-based devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FIPS validating a crypto library on a resource-constrained device can be more involved than doing a validation on a standard desktop-like platform.  Variances in OS, Flash/RAM, filesystem (or lack of), entropy, communication, and more can make things interesting.  Going through our past ARM-based validations, we have figured out how to make this process easier with wolfCrypt!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are interested in exploring FIPS 140-2 cryptography validations on ARM platforms, reach out to us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@wolfssl.com/&quot;&gt;info@wolfssl.com&lt;/a&gt;!</description>

      <description>Greetings! In this post we are covering Operational Environment’s (OE’s) we worked with this past year. These OE’s were validated under an OEM relationship where the company validating is licensed to resell the wolfCrypt FIPS product under their own brand name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;wolfSSL was particularly excited about both of these projects as they display the great range of capabilities for wolfSSL and the &lt;a href=&quot;../fips.html&quot;&gt;wolfCrypt FIPS module&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first OE was an embedded system with Cortex M4 processor and the second was a backend server where the wolfSSL product scales nicely due to reduced run-time resource use! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;wolfSSL is happy to assist with OEM FIPS validation and rebranding if the situation fits! We would love to hear from you, contact us anytime: &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:fips@wolfssl.com/&quot;&gt;fips@wolfssl.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you missed the first part in our series, you can read it &lt;a href=&quot;Entries/2017/7/25_wolfSSL_FIPS_A_Year_in_Review_%28Part_1_of_a_3_Part_Series%29.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!</description>

      <title>wolfSSL 3.12.0 Now Available</title>
      <link>http://www.wolfssl.com/wolfSSL/Blog/Entries/2017/8/7_wolfSSL_3.12.0_Now_Available.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">86bdb208-4b6c-4bef-b4a0-56ac2af1b586</guid>
      <pubDate>Mon, 7 Aug 2017 15:13:16 -0700</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;../Products-wolfssl.html&quot;&gt;wolfSSL&lt;/a&gt; 3.12.0 is now available for &lt;a href=&quot;https://wolfssl.com/wolfSSL/download/downloadForm.php&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;! This release contains bug fixes, new features, and includes fixes for one security vulnerability (low level).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The one low level vulnerability fix included in this release is in relation to a potential DoS attack on a wolfSSL client. Previously a client would accept many warning alert messages without a limit. This fix puts a limit to the number of warning alert messages received and if this limit is reached a fatal error ALERT_COUNT_E is returned. The max number of warning alerts by default is set to 5 and can be adjusted with the macro WOLFSSL_ALERT_COUNT_MAX. Thanks for the report from Tarun Yadav and Koustav Sadhukhan from Defence Research and Development Organization, INDIA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continue reading below for a summary of the features and fixes included in this release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TLS 1.3 Support!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you follow wolfSSL’s blog, you may have heard discussion about our TLS 1.3 BETA support.  wolfSSL 3.12.0 is the first stable release that contains our TLS 1.3 support (client and server side)!  This means that you can pair TLS 1.3 with your favorite other features and project ports too!  TLS 1.3 with &lt;a href=&quot;http://nginx.org/&quot;&gt;Nginx&lt;/a&gt;!  TLS 1.3 with ARMv8!  and TLS 1.3 with Async Crypto!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enable TLS 1.3 draft 20 support using the “--enable-tls13” configure option, or the older draft 18 support with the “--enable-tls13-draft18” option.  wolfSSL also supports 0RTT with TLS 1.3, which can be enabled with “--enable-earlydata”.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information about using wolfSSL with TLS 1.3, visit our &lt;a href=&quot;https://wolfssl.com/tls13&quot;&gt;TLS 1.3 webpage&lt;/a&gt;, or contact us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:support@wolfssl.com/&quot;&gt;support@wolfssl.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build and Configure Option Changes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Added enable all feature (--enable-all)&lt;br/&gt;- Added trackmemory feature (--enable-trackmemory)&lt;br/&gt;- Fixes for compiling wolfSSL with GCC version 7, most dealing with switch statement fall through warnings.&lt;br/&gt;- Added warning when compiling without hardened math operations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intel Assembly Improvements, Intel SGX Linux Support, and Intel QuickAssist Support&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For users of wolfSSL on Intel platforms, we have made improvements including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	-	A port of wolfSSL for &lt;a href=&quot;Entries/2017/6/14_wolfSSL_with_Intel_SGX_on_Linux.html&quot;&gt;Intel SGX with Linux&lt;/a&gt;.  We previously only supported Intel SGX with Windows.&lt;br/&gt;- AVX and AVX2 assembly instructions for improved ChaCha20 performance&lt;br/&gt;- Intel QAT fixes for when using --disable-fastmath&lt;br/&gt;	-	Improvements and enhancements to Intel QuickAssist support&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: There is a known issue with using ChaCha20 AVX assembly on versions of GCC earlier than 5.2. This is encountered with using the wolfSSL enable options “--enable-intelasm” and “--enable-chacha”. To avoid this issue ChaCha20 can be enabled with “--enable-chacha=noasm”.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If using “--enable-intelasm” and also using “--enable-sha224” or “--enable-sha256” there is a known issue with trying to use “-fsanitize=address”.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Official SHA-3 Support (Keccak)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previously wolfSSL only supported the SHA-3 runner-up Blake2b.  wolfSSL now additionally supports the final SHA-3 winner, Keccak.  This can be enabled with the “--enable-sha3” configure option.  It is enabled by default on x86_64 platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DTLS Multicast and Updates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For our DTLS users, wolfSSL now supports DTLS Multicast with “--enable-mcast”!  In addition, this release also contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- An update to how DTLS handles decryption and MAC failures&lt;br/&gt;	-	An update to the DTLS session export version number for use with the “--enable-sessionexport” option&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more details about DTLS Multicast, get in touch with us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@wolfssl.com/&quot;&gt;info@wolfssl.com&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New and Updated Hardware Ports&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this release, we have update several of our hardware ports and added a few new ones as well, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Update and fix for our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microchip.com/design-centers/32-bit/architecture/pic32mz-family&quot;&gt;Microchip PIC32MZ&lt;/a&gt; port&lt;br/&gt;- Fix for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm32f4-series.html&quot;&gt;STM32F4&lt;/a&gt; AES-GCM&lt;br/&gt;- Addition of a Xilinx port, based on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://zedboard.org/product/ultrazed-EG&quot;&gt;UltraZed-EG Starter Kit&lt;/a&gt; based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc/zynq-ultrascale-mpsoc.html&quot;&gt;Xilinx Zynq® UltraScale+™ MPSoC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Addition of SHA-224 and AES key wrap to ARMv8 port&lt;br/&gt;	-	Additional input argument sanity checks to ARMv8 assembly port&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enhanced Testing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Additional unit testing for MD5, SHA, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, RipeMd, HMAC, 3DES, IDEA, ChaCha20, ChaCha20Poly1305 AEAD, Camellia, Rabbit, ARC4, AES, RSA, HC-128&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Updated Operating System Ports&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Update &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ti.com/tool/ti-rtos&quot;&gt;TI-RTOS&lt;/a&gt; port for dependency on new wolfSSL source files&lt;br/&gt;- Update &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nxp.com/products/developer-resources/run-time-software/mqx-software-solutions/mqx-real-time-operating-system-rtos/mqx-classic-software-solutions:MQX&quot;&gt;MQX Classic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers-and-processors/more-processors/coldfire-plus-coldfire-32-bit-mcus/crypto-acceleration-unit-cau-and-mmcau-software-library:CAUAP&quot;&gt;mmCAU&lt;/a&gt; ports&lt;br/&gt;- Fix &lt;a href=&quot;http://rtos.com/products/threadx/&quot;&gt;ThreadX&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;http://rtos.com/products/netx/&quot;&gt;NetX&lt;/a&gt; warning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;wolfSSL Python Wrapper&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	-	Expand wolfSSL Python wrapper to now include a client side implementation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wolfssl.github.io/wolfssl-py/&quot;&gt;wolfSSL Python Wrapper Documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wolfssl.github.io/wolfcrypt-py/&quot;&gt;wolfCrypt Python Wrapper Documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other Additions and Modifications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other changes that this release contains includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Fix for making PKCS12 dynamic types match&lt;br/&gt;- Fixes for potential memory leaks when using --enable-fast-rsa&lt;br/&gt;- Fix for when using custom ECC curves and add BRAINPOOLP256R1 test&lt;br/&gt;- Fix for Async crypto with GCC 7.1 and HMAC when not using Intel QuickAssist&lt;br/&gt;- Added more sanity checks to fp_read_unsigned_bin function&lt;br/&gt;- Fix for potential buffer over read with wolfSSL_CertPemToDer&lt;br/&gt;- Add PKCS7/CMS decode support for KARI with IssuerAndSerialNumber&lt;br/&gt;- Added RSA PSS sign and verify&lt;br/&gt;- Fixes for AES key wrap and PKCS7 on Windows VS&lt;br/&gt;- Support use of staticmemory with PKCS7&lt;br/&gt;- Fix for Blake2b build with GCC 5.4&lt;br/&gt;- Fixes for OCSP and CRL non blocking sockets and for incomplete cert chain with OCSP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Updated Examples&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Adjust example servers to not treat a peer closed error as a hard error&lt;br/&gt;- Added benchmark block size argument&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have any questions about the new release, or using wolfSSL in your project, please contact us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@wolfssl.com/&quot;&gt;info@wolfssl.com&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>libFuzzer, a fuzzing engine created by LLVM, is now being used to test the &lt;a href=&quot;../Products-wolfssl.html&quot;&gt;wolfSSL library&lt;/a&gt;. Below is a short description of libFuzzer, taken from LLVM’s website &lt;a href=&quot;http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html#introduction&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LibFuzzer is linked with the library under test, and feeds fuzzed inputs to the library via a specific fuzzing entrypoint (aka “target function”); the fuzzer then tracks which areas of the code are reached, and generates mutations on the corpus of input data in order to maximize the code coverage. The code coverage information for libFuzzer is provided by LLVM’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://clang.llvm.org/docs/SanitizerCoverage.html&quot;&gt;SanitizerCoverage&lt;/a&gt; instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this tool, wolfSSL API are being tested on how well they can handle random gibberish, poorly formatted certificates, and other forms of data that are created and input by the user. These tests are being used to detect buffer-overflow bugs, segmentation faults, memory leaks, undefined behaviors, and many other bugs that could potentially be used to exploit the wolfSSL library. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are interested in further details of how wolfSSL is using libFuzzer, email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@wolfssl.com/&quot;&gt;info@wolfssl.com&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

      <description>Black Hat returns to Las Vegas for its 20th year. This six-day event will be held at Mandalay Bay Convention Center, July 22nd through July 27th. We will have several engineering staff on hand to answer all of your questions and you can check out all our exciting products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ask us about the release of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wolfssl.com/wolfSSL/Products.html&quot;&gt;TLS 1.3&lt;/a&gt; and the many benefits that TLS 1.3 offers. One significant difference is that &lt;a href=&quot;../wolfssl-tls13.html&quot;&gt;TLS 1.3&lt;/a&gt; only requires 1 round-trip, this means less time is required. Another difference is the way session resumption works. If you would like to find out more stop by our booth 971.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't miss out register today: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blackhat.com/us-17/registration.html&quot;&gt;https://www.blackhat.com/us-17/registration.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are already planning on attending please stop by, say hello and chat with us about cryptography, SSL/TLS, and hardware encryption. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you would like to set up a specific meeting time, please contact us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@wolfssl.com/&quot;&gt;info@wolfssl.com&lt;/a&gt;, or call us at (425) 245-8247. Stay up to date with what is happening with wolfSSL, follow our &lt;a href=&quot;https://wolfssl.com/wolfSSL/Blog/Blog.html&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; for the most recent news.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We look forward to hearing from you!</description>

      <description>wolfSSL is pleased to bring our community a report of the past years &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wolfssl.com/wolfSSL/fips.html&quot;&gt;FIPS&lt;/a&gt; activities. In part one of this three-part series we will cover the new Operating Environments (OEs) added to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140val-all.htm#2425&quot;&gt;wolfSSL certificate&lt;/a&gt; in the past year + CAVP algorithm testing done by wolfSSL.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Part two of this series will cover OEs tested by wolfSSL for OEM partners.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Part Three of this series will cover on-site consulting services offered by wolfSSL and some of the commentary from our on-site consulting engineers.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This past year wolfSSL added the following OEs to the wolfCrypt certificate on 06/23/2016&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;wolfSSL also performed algorithm testing or CAVP only validation for AES in these OEs:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following AES modes of operation were tested: ECB, CBC, CMAC, GMAC, and GCM. The algo certificates can be visited via the following links.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/aes/aesval.html#4452&quot;&gt;http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/aes/aesval.html#4452&lt;/a&gt; (3/31/2017)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/aes/aesval.html#4027&quot;&gt;http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/aes/aesval.html#4027&lt;/a&gt; (7/31/2016)&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;wolfSSL also performed algorithm testing or CAVP only validation for SHA-256 on the Same OEs.&lt;br/&gt;Those certificates can be found via the following links.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/shs/shaval.html#3665&quot;&gt;http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/shs/shaval.html#3665&lt;/a&gt; (3/31/2017)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/shs/shaval.html#3320&quot;&gt;http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/shs/shaval.html#3320&lt;/a&gt; (7/31/2016)&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; wolfSSL offers several FIPS services including but not limited to: OEM revalidations, on-site consulting for receiving your own FIPS validation, or just a traditional FIPS validation for your operating environment. For more info please contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:fips@wolfssl.com/&quot;&gt;fips@wolfssl.com&lt;/a&gt; and we will be happy to discuss details with you!&lt;br/&gt;</description>
